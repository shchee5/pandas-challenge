## Description
The company would like to generate a report that breaks down the purchasing data on Heroes of Pymoli, a fantasy game, into meaningful insights. 

## How to Run Code
Clone this repository and run code in Jupyter Lab.

## Results
Below are three insights drawn from the Heroes of Pymoli dataset:

1. While the number of purchases from males is almost 6x the number of purchases from females, the average total purchase per person for females is 9.8% higher than males.
2. Almost 45% of total purchases come from ages between 20 and 24. The average total purchase per person in that age range is $4.32, which is about 42% higher than the average item purchase based on total revenue ($3.05).
3. The most popular and profitable items are "Final Critic" and "Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm", each exceeding 10 purchase counts and generating more than $50 from purchases. 

Based on the insights above, the recommendation is to launch two campaigns, one targeting femals and the other targeting those in the 20-24 age group. The campaigns should consist of discounts or specials toward top items among the target demographic. The company should also consider investing in paid ads for "Final Critic" and "Oathbreaker" items given that they are the most popular and profitable items.
